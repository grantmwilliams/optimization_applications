%% Get Fitness Function
fitness_function = 3;
% 1 for f(x) = x^3
% 2 for f(x) = sin(x)
% 3 for f(x) = tan^2(x)/e^x


%% Assign Boundary Conditions
if (fitness_function == 1)
    boundary_conditions = [-10, 10];
    
elseif (fitness_function == 2)
    boundary_conditions = [-6.28, 6.28];
    
elseif (fitness_function == 3)
    boundary_conditions = [-3, 3];
end % end fitness function boundary conditions

%% Set Up Initial Guesses

start_point = sum(abs(boundary_conditions)); % Take the middle point of our domain


%% Use Function to Return Optimum Point
optimum_point = interval_halving_parallel(fitness_function,boundary_conditions,start_point);

disp(optimum_point);
